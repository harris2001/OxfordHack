## What it does
Flowy provides a dynamic load balancing for improving the efficiency of the social media platform. By identify clusters of users that have similar interest it can rapidly query the database and find content relevant to user's preferences. 

## How we built it
We used the LENS protocol to deploy Flowy on the blockchain and Google-Vision-API for image classification on users' posts

## Challenges we ran into
We couldn't complete the entire project within the given timeframe but a good foundation has been set

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have simulated our approach we have observed some fair improvement in information retrieval.

## What we learned
A fair improvement in performance can be achieved if we manage to run this on a larger scale.
This can also be very useful for platforms that use algorithms similar to TickToc where user's short interest span is taken into consideration for a more efficient recommendation.
